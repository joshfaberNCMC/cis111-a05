I feel like I have a base level understanding of scss down but I definitely need more time with it. I feel like I completed this assignment adequately but I'm not happy with it like I have been with every other assignment in this class. I kinda feel like I barely scraped by and I don't love that feeling. I think part of it is just how much time I sunk into learning css the first few months of this class... like literally hundreds of hours and I'm kinda stuck in my ways even though I can already see the benefits of using scss instead. I know for sure my organization and nesting in the assignment was kind of a mess but I can see the idea behind it now and I know it'll get better with a bit of practice. I think one or two more assignments being forced to use it would do a lot for me as well as if you go over it again in class now that I have somewhat of an understanding of it. The first time you went over it in class I paid attention but it's hard to retain that information without knowing what you're looking at to begin with.
